# docker-precise64-system-ruby-1.9.3

A Dockerfile for building Ubuntu Precise amd64 with system ruby 1.9.3.  
It is expected that this will be built and then used as a clean base image.  

Based on the official Ubuntu Precise base image which is a Ubuntu minimal install with the system ruby 1.9.3 package installed and the system ruby 1.8.7 removed.
The bundler gem is then installed.

This is the only changes that have been made.
